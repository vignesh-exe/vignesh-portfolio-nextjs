- **Integration Hub**: Seamless connectivity with existing government systems and third-party service providers.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Built a responsive, component-based user interface optimized for both desktop and mobile government workflows.
- **TypeScript**: Ensured type safety and improved code maintainability across the large-scale government application.
- **Redux**: Implemented centralized state management for complex data flows between multiple government departments and services.
- **Material UI**: Utilized Google's design system to create an intuitive, accessible interface that meets government accessibility standards.
- **GraphQL**: Developed efficient API layer for real-time data fetching and seamless integration with government databases and external services.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Implementation

```typescript
// State management for government services
interface GovernmentServiceState {
  services: Service[];
  userPermissions: Permission[];
  activeRequests: ServiceRequest[];
  analytics: AnalyticsData;
}

// Real-time dashboard component
const MCITDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(GET_DASHBOARD_METRICS);
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch();

  return (
    <Grid container spacing={3}>
      <ServiceMetrics data={data?.serviceMetrics} />
      <NetworkStatus status={data?.networkHealth} />
      <CitizenEngagement metrics={data?.engagement} />
    </Grid>
  );
};


## 🔐 Security Implementation

### ✅ JWT Token Management
Secure token-based authentication with automatic refresh mechanisms.

### ✅ Data Encryption
End-to-end encryption for sensitive government communications.
