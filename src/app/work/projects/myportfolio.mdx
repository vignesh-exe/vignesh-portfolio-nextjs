## Technical Implementation

### React Component Architecture

```jsx
// Main portfolio layout component
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import Header from './components/Header';
import Hero from './components/Hero';
import About from './components/About';
import Projects from './components/Projects';
import Skills from './components/Skills';
import Contact from './components/Contact';
import Footer from './components/Footer';

const Portfolio = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check for saved theme preference
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
    if (savedTheme) {
      setDarkMode(savedTheme === 'dark');
    } else {
      // Check system preference
      setDarkMode(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches);
    }
    setIsLoading(false);
  }, []);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const newTheme = !darkMode;
    setDarkMode(newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme ? 'dark' : 'light');
  };

  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }

  return (
    <div className={`${darkMode ? 'dark' : ''} transition-colors duration-300`}>
      <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-white min-h-screen">
        <Header darkMode={darkMode} toggleTheme={toggleTheme} />

        <main>
          <Hero />
          <About />
          <Skills />
          <Projects />
          <Contact />
        </main>

        <Footer />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Portfolio;
```
