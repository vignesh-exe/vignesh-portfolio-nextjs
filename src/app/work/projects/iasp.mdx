## Overview

IASP (Intelligent Application Security Platform) is a comprehensive cybersecurity solution designed to provide enterprise-grade vulnerability assessment and management capabilities. The platform combines advanced threat detection algorithms with intuitive user interfaces to help security teams identify, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities across their application portfolio in real-time.

## Key Features

### üîç Advanced Vulnerability Assessment

- **Automated Security Scanning**: Continuous monitoring of web applications, APIs, and infrastructure components using industry-standard security testing methodologies.
- **Multi-Vector Analysis**: Comprehensive assessment covering OWASP Top 10, SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and custom vulnerability patterns.
- **Code Analysis Integration**: Static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) with detailed code-level vulnerability reporting.

### ‚ö° Real-time Threat Detection

- **Live Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of security events, attack patterns, and system health across all monitored applications.
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Smart notification system that prioritizes critical vulnerabilities and reduces false positives through machine learning algorithms.
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Advanced pattern recognition to detect anomalous activities and potential zero-day exploits.

### üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Workflow Management

- **Automated Ticketing**: Seamless integration with JIRA, ServiceNow, and other enterprise ticketing systems for streamlined vulnerability management.
- **Remediation Guidance**: Step-by-step remediation instructions with code examples and best practice recommendations.
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of vulnerability lifecycle from detection to resolution with detailed audit trails.

### üìä Enterprise Security Analytics

- **Risk Assessment Metrics**: Quantitative risk scoring based on CVSS standards, business impact, and exploitability factors.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of compliance reports for SOC 2, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other regulatory frameworks.
- **Executive Dashboards**: High-level security posture visualization for C-level executives and security leadership.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Built a responsive, component-based frontend with real-time data visualization capabilities for security monitoring and management.
- **Node.js**: Developed a robust backend API with Express.js framework, handling high-volume security data processing and real-time event streaming.
- **CSS**: Implemented custom styling with CSS Grid and Flexbox for complex dashboard layouts, ensuring optimal user experience across security workflows.

## üîê Security Features
