Figma has become the go-to tool for modern UI/UX design. Combine that with React and Tailwind CSS, and you've got a lightning-fast workflow from idea to fully functional interface. In this blog, I'll walk you through my design-to-code process, using real practices I applied during my internship.

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

- How to design clean UIs in Figma with proper component structure
- How to break down designs into reusable React components
- How to style your components efficiently using Tailwind CSS
- Pro tips I picked up during real-world projects
- Advanced workflow optimizations for team collaboration

## 🔧 Step 1: Design Your UI in Figma

Start with a wireframe or layout idea. For this demo, let's say I'm designing a **Login Page** that needs to work across all devices.

### ✏️ My Figma Layout Includes:

- **Logo + Welcome Text** - Brand identity and user greeting
- **Input fields** for Email & Password with proper states
- **Primary Login Button** with hover and focus states
- **Secondary Link** to Sign Up page
- **Mobile-first layout** that scales up beautifully

> **💡 Internship Tip:** Use auto-layout for buttons, forms, and containers. It saves time when handing off to developers or resizing for mobile. Set up your spacing tokens early!

### Figma Best Practices I Follow:

1. **Use Components & Variants** - Create button components with different states
2. **Consistent Spacing** - Use 8px grid system (8, 16, 24, 32px)
3. **Typography Scale** - Define text styles (14px, 16px, 20px, 24px)
4. **Color Tokens** - Create a proper color palette with semantic names

## 🧩 Step 2: Break It Down Into Components

From the Figma layout, I extract these reusable components:

- `<AuthLayout />` - Overall page structure
- `<LoginForm />` - Main form container
- `<InputField />` - Reusable input with validation
- `<PrimaryButton />` - Button with variants
- `<Logo />` - Brand component

Component-driven thinking makes it easier to build, reuse, and test each part. This approach also makes handoffs to other developers seamless.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Name your Figma components exactly as you plan to name your React components. This makes the design-to-code handoff much smoother.

## 💻 Step 3: Code It with React + Tailwind CSS

Let's implement each component step by step, starting with the most reusable ones:

### InputField Component

```jsx
// components/ui/InputField.jsx
import { useState, forwardRef } from 'react';
import { EyeIcon, EyeSlashIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';

const InputField = forwardRef(
  ({ type = 'text', label, placeholder, error, helperText, required = false, className = '', ...props }, ref) => {
    const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useState(false);
    const [focused, setFocused] = useState(false);

    const isPassword = type === 'password';
    const inputType = isPassword && showPassword ? 'text' : type;

    return (
      <div className="space-y-1">
        {label && (
          <label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">
            {label}
            {required && <span className="text-red-500 ml-1">*</span>}
          </label>
        )}

        <div className="relative">
          <input
            ref={ref}
            type={inputType}
            placeholder={placeholder}
            className={`
            w-full px-4 py-3 rounded-lg border transition-all duration-200
            placeholder:text-gray-400
            ${
              error
                ? 'border-red-300 focus:ring-red-500 focus:border-red-500 bg-red-50'
                : focused
                ? 'border-blue-500 ring-2 ring-blue-500 ring-opacity-20'
                : 'border-gray-300 hover:border-gray-400'
            }
            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-opacity-20
            disabled:bg-gray-50 disabled:text-gray-500 disabled:cursor-not-allowed
            ${className}
          `}
            onFocus={() => setFocused(true)}
            onBlur={() => setFocused(false)}
            {...props}
          />

          {isPassword && (
            <button
              type="button"
              className="absolute inset-y-0 right-0 pr-3 flex items-center"
              onClick={() => setShowPassword(!showPassword)}
            >
              {showPassword ? (
                <EyeSlashIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600" />
              ) : (
                <EyeIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600" />
              )}
            </button>
          )}
        </div>

        {error && (
          <p className="text-sm text-red-600 flex items-center gap-1">
            <svg className="w-4 h-4" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 20 20">
              <path
                fillRule="evenodd"
                d="M18 10a8 8 0 11-16 0 8 8 0 0116 0zm-7 4a1 1 0 11-2 0 1 1 0 012 0zm-1-9a1 1 0 00-1 1v4a1 1 0 102 0V6a1 1 0 00-1-1z"
                clipRule="evenodd"
              />
            </svg>
            {error}
          </p>
        )}

        {helperText && !error && <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{helperText}</p>}
      </div>
    );
  }
);

InputField.displayName = 'InputField';

export default InputField;

</CodeBlock>

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This Figma → React + Tailwind workflow helped me quickly turn designs into clean, reusable components. It's also easier to work in a team when your designs map directly to code.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Start with good design foundations** in Figma
2. **Think in components** from the beginning
3. **Use consistent spacing and typography**
4. **Make it responsive from day one**
5. **Don't forget interaction states**
